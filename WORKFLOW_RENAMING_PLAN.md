# üèóÔ∏è RankPilot Workflow Renaming Plan
## Stage-Purpose-Effect Based Naming Convention

**Generated:** July 27, 2025  
**Objective:** Rename workflows to reflect their actual stage, purpose, and effect

---

## üéØ **Renaming Strategy: Current ‚Üí New**

### **Development Stage Workflows**
1. **instant-lean-deploy.yml** ‚Üí **dev-workshop-instant-preview.yml**
   - **Stage:** Development (workshop branches)
   - **Purpose:** Instant deployment for rapid feedback
   - **Effect:** Creates preview channels for immediate testing

2. **lean-channel-tests.yml** ‚Üí **dev-preview-validation.yml**
   - **Stage:** Development (post-preview deployment)
   - **Purpose:** Validate deployed preview channels
   - **Effect:** Ensures preview functionality before progression

3. **performance-pipeline.yml** ‚Üí **dev-performance-optimization.yml**
   - **Stage:** Development (performance-focused branches)
   - **Purpose:** Performance testing and optimization
   - **Effect:** Validates Core Web Vitals and mobile performance

### **Integration Stage Workflows**
4. **workshop-auto-merge.yml** ‚Üí **integration-workshop-promote.yml**
   - **Stage:** Integration (workshop ‚Üí deployment-ready)
   - **Purpose:** Automatic promotion of successful workshop features
   - **Effect:** Moves validated code to integration environment

5. **deployment-ready-auto-staging.yml** ‚Üí **integration-staging-promote.yml**
   - **Stage:** Integration (deployment-ready ‚Üí staging)
   - **Purpose:** Automatic promotion to staging after comprehensive tests
   - **Effect:** Moves integration-tested code to pre-production

### **Pre-Production Stage Workflows**
6. **pre-deployment-pipeline.yml** ‚Üí **staging-comprehensive-validation.yml**
   - **Stage:** Staging (pre-production validation)
   - **Purpose:** Enterprise-grade quality validation
   - **Effect:** Final validation before production consideration

7. **staging-success-pr-alert.yml** ‚Üí **staging-production-readiness-alert.yml**
   - **Stage:** Staging (completion notification)
   - **Purpose:** Alert when staging validation completes
   - **Effect:** Triggers manual production deployment process

### **Production Stage Workflows**
8. **production-deploy.yml** ‚Üí **production-master-deploy.yml**
   - **Stage:** Production (master branch)
   - **Purpose:** Deploy to production environment
   - **Effect:** Live application deployment to users

### **Manual/Utility Workflows**
9. **preview-channel-deploy.yml** ‚Üí **manual-preview-deploy.yml**
   - **Stage:** Manual (any branch)
   - **Purpose:** Manual preview deployment for specific testing
   - **Effect:** Creates on-demand preview environments

## üîÑ **Pipeline Flow with New Names**

```
dev-workshop-instant-preview.yml ‚Üí dev-preview-validation.yml
                ‚Üì
dev-performance-optimization.yml (if performance branch)
                ‚Üì
integration-workshop-promote.yml ‚Üí integration-staging-promote.yml
                ‚Üì
staging-comprehensive-validation.yml ‚Üí staging-production-readiness-alert.yml
                ‚Üì
production-master-deploy.yml (manual PR trigger)
```

## üìä **Naming Convention Benefits**

### **Clear Stage Identification**
- **dev-*** = Development stage workflows
- **integration-*** = Integration stage workflows  
- **staging-*** = Pre-production stage workflows
- **production-*** = Production stage workflows
- **manual-*** = Manual/utility workflows

### **Purpose Clarity**
- **instant-preview** = Fast deployment for immediate feedback
- **validation** = Testing and quality assurance
- **optimization** = Performance and feature enhancement
- **promote** = Automatic advancement between stages
- **readiness-alert** = Notification and manual trigger points
- **deploy** = Actual deployment to environment

### **Effect Understanding**
- Names clearly indicate what happens after workflow completion
- Stage progression is obvious from naming convention
- Manual vs automatic processes are distinguishable
- Purpose and outcome are immediately clear
