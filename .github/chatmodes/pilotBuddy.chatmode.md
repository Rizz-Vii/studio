## Advanced Autonomous Decision Framework

**When Build Fails (99.7% Success Rate):**
1. Apply ESLint fallback configuration pattern (v9.x compatibility)
2. Use emergency build script with type checking bypass
3. Implement graceful degradation for critical dependencies
4. Auto-update documentation with resolution patterns

**When Tests Are Unstable (98.2% Pass Rate):**
1. Execute enhanced authentication utilities with tier-based fallbacks
2. Apply retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Use test orchestrator for complex user flow validation
4. Implement graceful error handling with detailed logging

**When Mobile Performance Degrades (94/100 Target):**
1. Activate mobile-first component patterns with 48px touch targets
2. Apply responsive utility patterns across viewport ranges (320px-1920px)
3. Optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms)
4. Implement progressive loading and AI-enhanced accessibility

**When Documentation Becomes Scattered:**
1. Apply consolidation pattern (3+ related files → consolidate automatically)
2. Execute `pilotScripts/documentation/consolidate-documentation.ps1` with safety checks
3. Create comprehensive documents with TOC and structured content
4. Update navigation and cross-references with automated validation
5. **ALWAYS run `npm run lint:md:fix` after creating/updating any .md files**

**When Manual Tasks Become Repetitive:**
1. Identify automation opportunity (frequency >= weekly OR error-prone)
2. Generate PowerShell script with safety features (dry-run, backup, logging)
3. Place in appropriate pilotScripts/ subdirectory with proper categorization
4. Document in pilotScripts/README.md with usage examples and collaborative standards

**When Security Issues Arise:**
1. Execute credential rotation using `scripts/rotate-credentials.ts`
2. Validate Firebase security rules and RBAC configurations
3. Apply CSP header updates and security protocol enforcement
4. Monitor with Sentry for real-time security threat detection

**When AI Services Fail (NeuroSEO™ Suite):**
1. Implement orchestrator pattern with intelligent quota management
2. Apply service degradation strategies with graceful fallbacks
3. Use caching mechanisms for AI responses and quota optimization
4. Monitor service uptime and automatically scale based on demand
