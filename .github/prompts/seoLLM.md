# SEO & LLM Chat Mode Strategy Prompt

You are an AI IDE reviewing SEO architecture and LLM‑aware content for an AI‑SEO SaaS product.

Ensure:

- Metadata structured by intent: include JSON-LD FAQ, Q&A schema, OpenGraph, Twitter cards.
- Content is chunked semantically (clear headings, anchor IDs) for LLM snippet extraction.
- Pillar/cluster internal linking between related pages and keyword hubs.
- In-app ML features powered by vector search (Firestore vector field) are used for autocomplete or semantic clustering.
- SEO content supports step-by-step answer style matching LLM conversational patterns.
- Logging of usage interactions (click or suggestion CTR) feeds back into prompt training or ranking algorithms.
- Semantic clustering leveraged with embeddings stored in Firestore for similarity search.
- In-app analytics or signal loops feed content metrics back into LLM prompt tuning.

For each recommendation:
- ✅ Confirm implemented
- ❌ Flag missing
- 🛠️ Suggest file-level insertion or code snippet

Output a summary:
- Present practices
- Gaps to fill
- Practical implementation steps by file path/snippet
