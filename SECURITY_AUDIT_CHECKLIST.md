# Firebase Security Audit Checklist for RankPilot

This checklist is based on modern web application security best practices, tailored for a Firebase-based SaaS platform like RankPilot. Regularly review these items to ensure the security and integrity of your application.

### üîê 1. Authentication & User Management

- [ ] **Enforce Strong Authentication**: All sign-in methods (Email/Password, Google) are enabled through the Firebase Authentication console.
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For higher-security roles (like 'admin'), consider prompting for MFA if your user base requires it. (This is a future enhancement).
- [ ] **Secure Session Management**: Using Firebase's client-side SDKs for session management, which handle token refresh automatically. No manual token storage in `localStorage`.
- [ ] **Password Policies**: Firebase Auth enforces strong password policies by default for email/password sign-up.
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: User roles ('user', 'admin') are defined and enforced in Firestore security rules.

### üóÑÔ∏è 2. Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)

- [ ] **Default Deny**: The rules start with `match /{document=**} { allow read, write: if false; }` to prevent any unauthorized access by default.
- [ ] **User Data Ownership**: Rules ensure users can only read and write their own data.
    - `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;` is used on the `/users/{userId}` path and subcollections.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - Admin users have read-only access to other users' data for the admin dashboard.
    - This is implemented using `get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'`.
- [ ] **Input Validation**: While Firestore rules can perform basic data validation (`request.resource.data`), complex validation should be handled in Cloud Functions or frontend logic before writing to the database.
- [ ] **No Unfettered Access**: Verify that no wildcard paths (`/{document=**}`) have broad `read` or `write` permissions.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 3. Cloud Functions & Backend Security

- [ ] **Authenticated Access**: If exposing Genkit flows via HTTP endpoints (e.g., through Cloud Functions), ensure they check for `context.auth` to verify the caller is authenticated.
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Use a library like `zod` to validate all incoming data for Genkit flows and other functions to prevent injection or invalid data. (This is already implemented in the provided flows).
- [ ] **Secret Management**:
    - No hardcoded API keys or secrets in the source code.
    - Use Firebase's built-in environment configuration for secrets (`firebase functions:config:set`).
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege for Functions**: The service account used by Cloud Functions should have the minimum IAM roles necessary to operate.

### üåê 4. Frontend & Network Security

- [ ] **HTTPS Enforced**: Firebase Hosting serves all content over HTTPS by default.
- [ ] **Hosting Headers**: Configure `firebase.json` to set important security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options.
- [ ] **API Key Security**:
    - The Firebase client-side API key is designed to be public but should be restricted.
    - In the Google Cloud Console, restrict the API key to your specific domain (`*.your-domain.com`).
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: For public-facing endpoints or intensive operations, consider implementing rate limiting with a service like Firebase App Check or a custom solution in your Cloud Functions.

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Monitoring & Maintenance

- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Use the audit logs in the Google Cloud Console for your Firebase project to monitor for suspicious activity, especially for Firestore and Cloud Functions.
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies and update them.
- [ ] **Regular Backups**: Configure scheduled backups for your Firestore database through the Google Cloud Console. Test the restore process periodically.
- [ ] **Review Permissions**: Periodically review the IAM roles assigned to project members and service accounts to ensure they are still appropriate.
