## Testing & Validation

### Development Authentication Setup:
The system now uses real Firebase authentication with comprehensive development convenience options:

1. **Main Login Flow** (`http://localhost:3000/login`)
   - Use standard email/password login with real Firebase credentials  
   - Email: `abbas_ali_rivi@hotmail.com` (Free tier user) - Email/Password auth
   - Email: `abba7254@gmail.com` (Starter tier user) - Google Sign-In auth
   - Supports both authentication methods seamlessly

2. **Development Quick Login** (Development Mode Only):
   - **Free User Button**: Uses email/password authentication with Firebase
   - **Starter User Button**: Uses Google Sign-In popup with account hint
   - Both buttons use real Firebase authentication methods
   - Automatic user type detection and appropriate auth method selection

3. **DevUserSwitcher** (Bottom-left corner in development):
   - **Free User**: Email/password authentication (`abbas_ali_rivi@hotmail.com`)
   - **Starter User**: Google Sign-In with account selection hint  
   - **Logout**: Standard Firebase sign-out
   - Shows current authenticated user email and auth method

4. **Billing System Integration**:
   - **Settings Tab**: Redirects to dedicated billing dashboard (`/settings/billing`)
   - **Dedicated Page**: Complete billing management at `/settings/billing`
   - **No Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate billing components
   - **Unified Experience**: Single source of truth for billing information

5. **Important Notes**:
   - Real Firebase users exist in the database with proper profiles
   - Development features use actual Firebase authentication (no mocking)
   - Google Sign-In properly configured for users who registered via Google
   - All subscription data fetched from real Firestore database
   - Billing tab in settings provides clear navigation to full billing dashboard

3. **Test Subscription Features:**
   - **Free User Testing:**
     - Limited to 3 tools in navigation
