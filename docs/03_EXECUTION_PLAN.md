# Document 3: Execution Plan & Progress - RankPilot

**Internal Project Name:** Studio
**Product Name:** RankPilot
**Date:** July 9, 2025
**Status:** Living Document - Updated at the end of each sprint.

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the technical execution plan for RankPilot (internally "Project Studio"). Development follows an agile methodology, structured in phases to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), implement monetization, and then expand features.

## 2. Technical Architecture Summary

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Cloud Functions (target for all core logic).
*   **Database:** Firestore (NoSQL).
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth).
*   **AI & Processing:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o), Playwright/Puppeteer, Embeddings APIs.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments from the `studio` repository.

## 3. Current Progress (As of July 9, 2025)

**Phase 0: Foundation & Setup - (100% Complete)**
*   ✅ Firebase Project Initialized
*   ✅ Next.js Frontend Bootstrapped
*   ✅ Firebase Auth Integrated (Email/Password)
*   ✅ Basic CI/CD Workflow Configured

**Phase 1: Core MVP - (60% Complete)**
*   ✅ Dashboard & Tools UI Framework Built
*   ✅ Core AI Audit Endpoint (`/api/audit`) Functional in Next.js
*   ✅ User Profile Management Page Live
*   ✅ Basic Firestore Data Models Implemented
*   🟡 **In Progress:** Harden Firestore Security Rules

## 4. Prioritized Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1 Completion: Hardening the Core (Target: Next 2 Sprints)

| Task ID | Description | Dependencies | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T1.1** | **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Add a `role` field to user profiles and use Firebase Custom Claims to enforce access on both frontend and backend. | Firebase Auth | **Not Started** |
| **T1.2** | **Implement Usage Quota System:** Create `usage` collection in Firestore. Check and increment usage on each audit. Implement a scheduled function to reset monthly quotas. | Firestore, RBAC | **Not Started** |
| **T1.3** | **Finalize Firestore Security Rules:** Refine `firestore.rules` to enforce strict per-user and role-based data access. | RBAC | **In Progress** |

### Phase 2: Monetization & Scalability (Target: Following 4 Sprints)

| Task ID | Description | Dependencies | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T2.1** | **Integrate Stripe Billing:** Implement Stripe Checkout and a webhook handler (Cloud Function) to manage subscription lifecycles and update user roles in Firestore. | Stripe Acct, RBAC | **Not Started** |
| **T2.2** | **Migrate Audit Logic to Cloud Functions:** Refactor the `/api/audit` logic into a scalable, secure Firebase Cloud Function. | Cloud Functions | **Not Started** |
| **T2.3** | **Implement PDF/CSV Export:** Integrate a library to generate reports from audit data in Firestore, triggered via a new endpoint or function. | Firestore data | **Not Started** |

### Phase 3: NeuroSEO™ Feature Expansion (Post-Launch)

*   **T3.1 - Enhance NeuralCrawler™:** Full Playwright/Puppeteer integration, robust error handling.
*   **T3.2 - Build SemanticMap™:** Advanced embedding analysis and topic gap visualization.
*   **T3.3 - Develop AI Visibility Engine:** Implement query simulation and citation analysis.
*   **T3.4 - Build TrustBlock™:** Implement detailed E-E-A-T checks.
*   **T3.5 - Develop RewriteGen™:** Integrate AI-powered rewriting tools.

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High LLM API Costs** | Medium | High | Implement strict quotas, cache results, optimize prompts, and explore fine-tuning or alternative models. |
| **Rapidly Changing AI Behavior** | High | High | Build a flexible AI integration layer (e.g., LangChain) to easily swap models/prompts. Dedicate R&D time to continuous monitoring. |
| **Scalability Bottlenecks** | Low | High | Proactive migration to Cloud Functions, use Pub/Sub for async tasks, and continuously monitor database performance. |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Medium | High | Adhere to strict security checklist, conduct regular audits, use managed secrets for production keys, and enforce hardened security rules. |
| **Low Customer Conversion** | Medium | High | Offer a compelling free tier, focus marketing on clear value props for target personas, and iterate on pricing/features based on user feedback. |
