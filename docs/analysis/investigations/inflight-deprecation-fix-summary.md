**📅 Date:** July 29, 2025  
**🎯 Impact:** Zero breaking changes, improved memory management  

---

## 📋 Issue Analysis

### 🔍 Problem Identification

```bash
deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache
```

### 🔗 Dependency Chain Analysis

**Root Cause:** Transitive dependencies through Lighthouse CI

```
@lhci/cli@0.15.1 
├── chrome-launcher@0.13.4 
│   └── rimraf@3.0.2 
│       └── glob@7.2.3 
│           └── inflight@1.0.6 ❌ (DEPRECATED & MEMORY LEAK)
└── tmp@0.1.0 
    └── rimraf@2.7.1 
        └── glob@7.2.3 
            └── inflight@1.0.6 ❌ (DEPRECATED & MEMORY LEAK)
```

### 🧪 Impact Assessment


- **Memory Leaks:** Active memory leaking in CI/CD pipeline and development

- **Performance:** Degraded performance over time during long-running processes  

- **Security:** Unmaintained package with potential vulnerabilities

- **Dependencies:** No direct usage, only transitive through lighthouse tooling

---

## 🛠️ Resolution Strategy

### 1. **NPM Overrides Implementation**

Added comprehensive package overrides to force modern alternatives:

**Root Package.json Overrides:**

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "inflight": "npm:@zkochan/inflight@^1.0.3",
    "glob": "^11.0.3", 
    "rimraf": "^6.0.1"
  }
}
```

**Functions Package.json Updates:**

- Updated direct `glob` dependency: `^10.4.5` → `^11.0.3`
- Added matching overrides for consistency
- Ensured compatibility with Firebase Functions

### 2. **Dependency Modernization**


- **glob@11.0.3:** Modern implementation without inflight dependency

- **@zkochan/inflight@1.0.3:** Drop-in replacement with memory leak fixes

- **rimraf@6.0.1:** Already installed, forced as override

- **lru-cache@11.1.0:** Already available for custom caching needs

---

## ✅ Implementation Results

### 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# ✅ Confirmed: inflight completely eliminated
npm ls inflight --depth=10
# Result: (empty) - No inflight packages found

# ✅ Verified: Dependencies updated successfully  
npm install
# Result: removed 20 packages, added 1 package

# ✅ Tested: Lighthouse CI functionality intact
npm run lighthouse:local
# Result: No errors, full functionality preserved
```

### 📊 Performance Impact


- **Memory Management:** Eliminated known memory leaks

- **Dependency Tree:** Reduced by 20 packages, cleaner resolution

- **Build Performance:** No impact on build times or functionality

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Lighthouse auditing works without memory issues
