## 1. Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end flow of work, ensuring consistency, quality, and clear communication across the team. The flow is designed to be agile and iterative, moving from high-level concepts to concrete, deployed features.

## 2. The Five Phases of Development

Our development process is broken down into five distinct phases:

| Phase                           | Description                                                                                              | Key Activities                                                                                                | Output                                                                   |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Concept & Prioritization** | An idea for a feature or improvement is proposed and evaluated for strategic fit and user impact.        | Brainstorming, user feedback analysis, market research, alignment with PRD/roadmap.                           | A prioritized item in the project backlog.                               |
| **2. Planning & Design**        | The prioritized feature is fleshed out. Requirements are detailed, and technical/UI design is completed. | Creating user stories, defining acceptance criteria, designing UI mockups/wireframes, architectural planning. | A detailed feature specification or ticket (e.g., in GitHub Issues).     |
| **3. Development & Testing**    | The feature is built, and quality is ensured through rigorous testing.                                   | Writing code, creating unit/integration tests, local testing, code reviews via pull requests.                 | A merged pull request with a feature-complete and tested implementation. |
| **4. Deployment**               | The feature is deployed to the live production environment.                                              | Running the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions), monitoring the deployment process.                               | The new feature is live for users on `rankpilot-h3jpc.web.app`.          |
| **5. Monitoring & Iteration**   | The feature's performance, usage, and impact are monitored post-launch.                                  | Tracking usage analytics, monitoring for errors/bugs, gathering user feedback.                                | New backlog items for bug fixes or future improvements.                  |

## 3. Workflow in Practice (GitHub)

1. **Issue Creation:** A new feature or bug is documented as a GitHub Issue. It is assigned to a project board for prioritization.
2. **Branching:** A developer creates a new feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/name-of-feature`.
3. **Development:** Code is written, and commits are made to the feature branch with clear, descriptive messages.
4. **Pull Request (PR):** Once development is complete, a Pull Request is opened to merge the feature branch into `main`. The PR description references the original GitHub Issue.
5. **Code Review & CI:**
   - At least one other team member must review the PR for quality, standards, and correctness.
   - The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs automatically to build the project and run any automated tests.
   - The PR cannot be merged until the review is approved and CI passes.
6. **Merge:** Upon approval, the PR is merged into the `main` branch.
7. **Automated Deployment:** The merge to `main` automatically triggers the production deployment workflow in GitHub Actions, which pushes the updated build to Firebase Hosting and deploys any new Cloud Functions.
8. **Verification:** The developer and/or a QA resource verifies the feature is working as expected in the production environment. The GitHub Issue is then closed.
