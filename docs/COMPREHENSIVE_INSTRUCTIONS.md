- Test isolation and proper mocking
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Role-based test structure using TestOrchestrator

#### Test Orchestration System

All tests should follow the standard role-based test pattern:

```typescript
// TestOrchestrator handles user flows and authentication
import { TestOrchestrator } from "../utils/test-orchestrator";
import { tierUserFlows } from "../flows/role-based-flows"; // tier = free, starter, agency, etc.

// Setup pattern
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  orchestrator = new TestOrchestrator(page);
  page.setDefaultNavigationTimeout(30000);
  page.setDefaultTimeout(20000);
});

// Usage pattern
const flow = userFlows.find((flow) => flow.name.includes("FeatureName"));
await orchestrator.executeFlow(flow);

// Authentication pattern
await orchestrator.userManager.loginAs("tierName"); // "free", "starter", "agency", "enterprise", "admin"
```

#### Standard Test Structure

```typescript
// Standard role-based test structure
test("User Tier - Feature Access", async ({ page }) => {
  // Find specific flow from predefined flows
  const featureFlow = tierUserFlows.find((flow) =>
    flow.name.includes("FeatureName")
  );

  // Execute flow via orchestrator
  await orchestrator.executeFlow(featureFlow);

  // Verify tier-specific elements
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="feature-results"]')).toBeVisible();
});

// Access restriction pattern
test("User Tier - Access Restrictions", async ({ page }) => {
  await orchestrator.userManager.loginAs("tierName");
  await page.goto("/restricted-feature");
  await expect(page.locator("text=/upgrade|premium|subscribe/i")).toBeVisible();
});
