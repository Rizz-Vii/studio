## Key Accomplishments

### Test Refactoring (July 2025) ✅ **NEW**

1. **Quality Tests Modernization**:
   - **SEO Tests** (`tests/quality/seo.spec.ts`): Simplified and optimized test structure
   - **Visual Regression** (`tests/quality/visual-regression.spec.ts`): Migrated to Playwright native visual comparison tools with pixel-to-pixel accuracy
   - Eliminated redundant code and improved test performance

2. **Integration Tests Enhancement**:
   - **API Tests** (`tests/integration/api.spec.ts`): Streamlined authentication logic and removed tests better suited for E2E
   - Improved test organization with proper grouping of related API functionality
   - Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities

3. **E2E Tests Complete Overhaul**:
   - **Dashboard Tests** (`tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`): Complete rewrite with modern Playwright patterns
   - **Authentication Helper**: Created robust `loginAndGoToDashboard` helper function
   - **Data-Driven Testing**: Implemented data-driven approach for navigation tests
   - **Test Organization**: Structured tests into logical describe blocks for better maintainability
   - **Tier-Specific Testing**: Enhanced tier-specific functionality validation

4. **Testing Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Standardized authentication flows across all test files
   - Eliminated code duplication and improved test reusability
   - Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
   - Improved test reliability and consistency

### Original Accomplishments (2024)

1. **Created Authentication Fixture**:
   - Implemented robust login helper in `tests/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts`
   - Added test credentials and authentication utilities
   - Created authentication fixture for tests requiring login

2. **Fixed Mobile Tests**:
   - Updated selectors to match actual implementation
   - Added proper timeouts for slower local development
   - Implemented better error handling and debugging

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `MOBILE_ENHANCEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Created `MOBILE_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
   - Updated `PROJECT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`

## Remaining Issues

1. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Title expectation in login page test needs updating
   - Form validation selectors need to be more specific
   - Error message handling needs updating

2. **API Contract Tests**:
   - Need to update endpoint expectations
   - May need to mock API responses for local testing

3. **General Test Stability**:
   - Some tests have intermittent failures
   - Need to make selectors more resilient

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Update Auth Test Expectations**:
   - Fix title expectations for login page
   - Update form validation selectors
   - Fix error message handling

2. **Create Test Environment Config**:
   - Create separate configs for local vs. deployed testing
   - Add test-specific environment variables

3. **Refactor Test Utilities**:
   - Move common test utilities to shared location
   - Create page object models for all major pages

4. **Add Test Documentation**:
   - Create documentation for running tests
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common test issues

## Test Run Commands

```bash
# Run all performance tests (most stable)
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/performance.spec.ts

# Run mobile accessibility tests
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/mobile-accessibility.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test --project=chromium -g "specific test name"

# Run with visible browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/performance.spec.ts --headed
```
