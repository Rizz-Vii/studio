# Testing Status Report

## Summary of Testing Progress

This report summarizes the current state of testing for the RankPilot project, specifically focusing on the mobile performance optimization branch.

**Project:** RankPilot  
**Branch:** feature/performance-optimization-mobile-enhancement  
**Date:** July 21, 2025

## Test Suite Status

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Performance Tests | âœ… Passing | All tests in performance.spec.ts now pass |
| Mobile Accessibility | âœ… Passing | Tests in mobile-accessibility.spec.ts pass for specified viewports |
| Authentication | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Successful login test passes, other auth tests need updates |
| API Contract | ðŸ”´ Failing | Need to address API endpoints |
| General Accessibility | ðŸ”´ Failing | Need to update selectors and expectations |

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Authentication Fixture**:
   - Implemented robust login helper in `tests/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts`
   - Added test credentials and authentication utilities
   - Created authentication fixture for tests requiring login

2. **Fixed Mobile Tests**:
   - Updated selectors to match actual implementation
   - Added proper timeouts for slower local development
   - Implemented better error handling and debugging

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `MOBILE_ENHANCEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Created `MOBILE_PERFORMANCE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
   - Updated `PROJECT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`

## Remaining Issues

1. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Title expectation in login page test needs updating
   - Form validation selectors need to be more specific
   - Error message handling needs updating

2. **API Contract Tests**:
   - Need to update endpoint expectations
   - May need to mock API responses for local testing

3. **General Test Stability**:
   - Some tests have intermittent failures
   - Need to make selectors more resilient

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Update Auth Test Expectations**:
   - Fix title expectations for login page
   - Update form validation selectors
   - Fix error message handling

2. **Create Test Environment Config**:
   - Create separate configs for local vs. deployed testing
   - Add test-specific environment variables

3. **Refactor Test Utilities**:
   - Move common test utilities to shared location
   - Create page object models for all major pages

4. **Add Test Documentation**:
   - Create documentation for running tests
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common test issues

## Test Run Commands

```bash
# Run all performance tests (most stable)
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/performance.spec.ts

# Run mobile accessibility tests
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/mobile-accessibility.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test --project=chromium -g "specific test name"

# Run with visible browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium tests/performance.spec.ts --headed
```
