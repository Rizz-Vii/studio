## 2. Target Audience & Personas

RankPilot serves professionals focused on driving online visibility.

| Persona   | Role                         | Key Pain Points                                                                                                 | RankPilot Solution                                                                                     |
| :-------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alex**  | **SEO Consultant (Agency)**  | Traditional tools don't measure AI performance. Manually optimizing for AI across many clients is inefficient.  | Large-scale audits, white-label reporting, and tangible AI citation metrics to demonstrate value.      |
| **Maria** | **Marketing Manager**        | Unsure how AI discovers and uses her company's content. Can't integrate AI insights into the content calendar.  | Identifies AI-covered topics, reveals content gaps, and makes "AI-friendliness" an actionable metric.  |
| **David** | **Content Writer**           | Content isn't getting cited by AI. Manually optimizing for semantic richness is a time-consuming guessing game. | Actionable, AI-powered rewrite suggestions and schema generation to enhance authority and relevance.   |
| **Chloe** | **Technical SEO Specialist** | Lacks an integrated tool that combines technical, semantic, and E-E-A-T analysis for AI.                        | Provides a unified audit of site structure, semantic relevance, and trust signals prioritized by LLMs. |

## 3. Product Scope: The NeuroSEO™ Feature Suite

RankPilot's functionality is delivered through a suite of integrated components.

- **3.1 NeuralCrawler™:** An intelligent crawler that renders JavaScript and extracts comprehensive content, technical data, and authorship signals. It performs initial semantic classification using embeddings.
- **3.2 SemanticMap™:** Analyzes extracted content using advanced NLP to create a "semantic fingerprint." It identifies missing subtopics and visualizes topic clusters, showing where a user's content is weak or redundant compared to an AI's understanding.
- **3.3 AI Visibility Engine:** Simulates how major LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Google SGE) answer relevant queries. It reports if the user's content is cited and provides insights into why or why not.
- **3.4 TrustBlock™:** Audits content for E-E-A-T signals, including author bios, external citations, Schema.org markup, and content recency, providing a quantifiable trust score.
- **3.5 RewriteGen™:** An AI-powered co-writer that suggests and generates optimized versions of titles, headings, and paragraphs for clarity, semantic density, and authority.
- **3.6 RankPilot Dashboards & Reporting:** An intuitive UI that centralizes all tools, reports, and account management, with robust PDF/CSV export functionality.

## 4. Out of Scope for v1.0

- **Traditional Rank Tracking:** Does not track keyword rankings in traditional search engines (e.g., Google's blue links).
- **Backlink Analysis:** Does not perform off-site backlink analysis like Ahrefs or Moz.
- **Content Hosting:** Does not host or directly edit user website files. It is an analysis and recommendation engine.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Success will be measured by a balanced scorecard.
