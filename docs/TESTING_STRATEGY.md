# Testing Strategy for RankPilot

## Current Situation
- Production URL: https://rankpilot-h3jpc.web.app
- Local development: Not currently running
- Changes: Not yet deployed to production

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Local Development Testing (RECOMMENDED)

**Setup:**
1. Start your local dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Run tests against localhost: `npm run test:local`

**Benefits:**
- Test your actual changes before deployment
- Faster feedback loop
- No production impact
- Real feature testing

### 2. Production Baseline Testing

**Setup:**
- Test current production version to establish baseline
- Identify what features exist vs what tests expect

**Benefits:**
- Understand current production state
- Create realistic test expectations
- Avoid false failures

### 3. Staging Environment (Future)

**Setup:**
- Deploy to Firebase preview channel
- Test against preview URL
- Deploy to production if tests pass

## Current Test Status

The tests are failing because they expect features that may not be in production:
- Specific navigation links (Features, Pricing, FAQ)
- Specific heading text ("SEO Insights")
- Specific CTA buttons ("Start Free", "Request Demo")
- Performance expectations (3s load time)

## Immediate Actions

1. **Start local development server**
2. **Update playwright config for local testing**
3. **Run tests against localhost**
4. **Fix any issues found**
5. **Deploy to production**
6. **Re-run production tests**

## Commands to Use

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test against localhost (with updated config)
npm run test:local

# Test against production
npm run test:prod
```
