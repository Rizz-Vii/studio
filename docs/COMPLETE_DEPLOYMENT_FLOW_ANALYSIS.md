## 📋 **Complete Workflow Mapping**

### **1. Development Hyperloop Infrastructure (infrastructure/deployment-ready)**

**🎯 Branch:** `infrastructure/deployment-ready`
**🚀 Triggers:**
- Push to any branch (except main/master/production)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**📦 Workflows:**
```yaml
# hyperloop-deploy.yml
- Instant Preview Deploy for all branches
- Universal branch deployment capability
- Fast build with lean configuration

# instant-lean-deploy.yml  
- Feature branch instant deployment
- Smart file change detection
- Skip build for documentation-only changes

# lean-channel-testing.yml
- Automated preview channel testing
- Performance validation
- Mobile optimization checks

# lean-channel-tests.yml
- Enhanced test orchestration
- Repository dispatch integration
- Cross-workflow communication
```

**🎛️ Deployment Targets:**
- Preview Channel: `hyperloop-preview`

### **2. Feature Development Flow (feature/*)**

**🎯 Branches:** 
- `feature/*` (general features)
- `feature/performance-*` (performance features)
- `bugfix/*` (bug fixes)
- `hotfix/*` (urgent fixes)

**🚀 Triggers:**

**For feature/performance-* branches:**
```yaml
# feature-performance-ci-cd.yml

  push:
    branches: 
      - feature/performance-optimization-mobile-enhancement
      - feature/performance-*
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - master
      - preDeploy
```

**For general feature/* branches:**
```yaml
# instant-lean-deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/*
      - bugfix/*
      - hotfix/*
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
```

**📊 7-Stage Performance Pipeline (feature/performance-*):**
1. **Stage 1:** Performance Feature Validation (5-7 min)
2. **Stage 2:** Core Web Vitals Testing (8-12 min)
3. **Stage 3:** Mobile Optimization (3-5 min)
4. **Stage 4:** Enhanced Testing Suite (10-15 min)
5. **Stage 5:** Security & Performance Audit (3-5 min)
6. **Stage 6:** Merge Readiness Check (2-3 min)

```

**🔒 Security & Quality Pipeline:**
- Security audit and vulnerability scanning
- Quality assurance and code review
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Build verification and testing
- Performance baseline validation

**🎛️ Deployment Target:**
- Staging Environment: `staging.rankpilot.com`
- Pre-production validation environment

---

### **4. Production Deployment (master)**

**🎯 Branch:** `master`
**🚀 Triggers:**
```yaml
# production-deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      deploy_functions: boolean
      emergency_deployment: boolean
```

**🏭 Production Pipeline:**
- Production build optimization
- Firebase Functions deployment
- Database migrations (if any)
- CDN cache invalidation
- Health checks and monitoring
- Rollback capability

**🎛️ Deployment Target:**
- Production: `rankpilot.com`
- Firebase Project: `rankpilot-h3jpc`
- Region: `australia-southeast2`

## ⚡ **Deployment Triggers & Commands**

### **Manual Deployment Commands**

**🚀 Development Hyperloop:**
```bash
# Trigger hyperloop deployment
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Manual hyperloop dispatch
gh workflow run hyperloop-deploy.yml

# Instant lean deployment
gh workflow run instant-lean-deploy.yml

# Test preview channels
gh workflow run lean-channel-testing.yml
```

**🎯 Performance Pipeline:**
```bash
# Push to performance branch
git push origin feature/performance-your-feature

# Manual performance pipeline
gh workflow run feature-performance-ci-cd.yml
```

**🔒 Pre-Deployment:**
```bash
# Push to pre-deployment
git push origin preDeploy

# Create PR to preDeploy
gh pr create --base preDeploy --head feature/your-feature
```

**🏭 Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Push to master (auto-deploy)
git push origin master

# Manual production deployment
gh workflow run production-deploy.yml

# Emergency deployment
