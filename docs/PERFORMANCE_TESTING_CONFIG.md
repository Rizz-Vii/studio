- **Mobile Accessibility:** 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Mobile UX Metrics

- **Touch Target Size:** Minimum 48px
- **Responsive Breakpoints:** Mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Loading State Engagement:** Educational tips effectiveness
- **Navigation Flow:** Breadcrumb usage and back button efficiency

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Performance Tests

1. **Keyword Tool Performance**
   - Test with various query lengths
   - Monitor caching effectiveness
   - Verify timeout handling

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Verify touch interactions
   - Check loading state animations

3. **User Feedback System**
   - Test feedback triggers
   - Verify rating system
   - Check feedback aggregation

### Test Data Sets

- **Short queries:** 1-3 words
- **Medium queries:** 4-8 words
- **Long queries:** 9+ words
- **Special characters:** Test Unicode and symbols
- **Network conditions:** Slow 3G, Fast 3G, WiFi

## 🔧 Debugging & Monitoring

### Performance Dashboard Access

- Navigate to `/performance-dashboard` in deployed app
- Monitor real-time metrics
- Check error rates and response times

### Key Components to Test

- `src/lib/performance-monitor.ts` - Metrics collection
- `src/lib/ai-optimizer.ts` - Caching system
- `src/components/mobile-tool-layout.tsx` - Mobile layouts
- `src/components/loading-state.tsx` - Loading states
- `src/components/performance-feedback.tsx` - Feedback system

## 📱 Mobile Testing Checklist

## 📝 Testing Workflow

1. **Push to branch** → Automatic deployment triggered
2. **Monitor build logs** → Check for build issues
3. **Access preview URL** → Test functionality
4. **Run performance tests** → Automated Playwright tests
5. **Check dashboard** → Monitor real-time metrics
6. **Collect feedback** → User testing results
7. **Iterate** → Make improvements based on data

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

### Daily Checks

- Review deployment status
- Check error logs
- Monitor performance metrics
- Test mobile functionality

### Weekly Analysis

- Analyze user feedback trends
- Review cache performance
- Optimize slow operations
- Update performance thresholds
