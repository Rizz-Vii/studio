## 🔄 **WORKFLOW CONSOLIDATION**

### **🗑️ Workflows to REMOVE (Duplicates)**
1. **lean-channel-testing.yml** → REMOVE (duplicate of lean-channel-tests.yml)
2. **hyperloop-deploy.yml** → REMOVE (duplicate of instant-lean-deploy.yml)

### **🔀 Workflows to MERGE**
1. **feature-performance-ci-cd.yml + performance-auto-deploy.yml** → **performance-pipeline.yml**

### **✅ Workflows to KEEP (8 Final)**
1. **instant-lean-deploy.yml** - Workshop instant deployment
2. **lean-channel-tests.yml** - Channel testing validation  
3. **performance-pipeline.yml** - Consolidated performance CI/CD
4. **pre-deployment-pipeline.yml** - Staging validation
5. **production-deploy.yml** - Master production deployment
6. **workshop-auto-merge.yml** - Auto-merge workshop → deployment-ready
7. **deployment-ready-auto-staging.yml** - Auto-merge deployment-ready → staging
8. **staging-success-pr-alert.yml** - Staging → master PR alerts
