## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **Responsible Disclosure Process**

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us at: **security@rankpilot.com**
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
5. We will credit you appropriately once the issue is resolved

### **What to Include in Your Report**

- **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the security issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or data exposure
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (with screenshots if applicable)
- **Suggested Fixes**: Any recommendations for remediation

### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: 
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next scheduled release

## 🛠️ Development Security Practices

### **Secure Coding Guidelines**

#### **Input Validation**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize all inputs
const validatedData = schema.parse(userInput);

// ❌ Bad: Direct use of user input
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userInput}`;
```

#### **Authentication Checks**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Verify authentication on every protected route
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const user = await verifyAuth(request);
  if (!user) return unauthorized();
  // ... protected logic
}
```

#### **Environment Variables**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef";
```

### **Security Testing Requirements**

#### **Automated Security Scanning**
- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit` on every build
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scans
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Cloud configuration reviews

#### **Manual Security Testing**
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external testing
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: For new features and major changes

## 🚦 Security Incident Response

### **Incident Classification**

#### **Critical (P0)**
- Data breach or unauthorized access
- System compromise
- Service unavailability affecting all users

#### **High (P1)**
- Privilege escalation

- Authentication bypass

#### **Medium (P2)**
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

#### **Low (P3)**
- Configuration issues
- Informational disclosures
- Best practice violations

### **Response Procedures**

1. **Detection & Analysis**
