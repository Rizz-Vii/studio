# 🏗️ Branch-Specific Workflow Distribution Plan

**Generated:** July 27, 2025  
**Strategy:** Move workflows to only exist in branches where they're actually needed

---

## 🎯 **Distribution Strategy**

### **Branch: `workshop/deployment-ready` (MAIN)** 
**Keep these workflows (3 total):**
- `integration-workshop-promote.yml` - Promotes FROM workshop branches
- `integration-staging-promote.yml` - Promotes TO staging
- `manual-preview-deploy.yml` - Manual utility (accessible from main integration branch)

### **Branch: `workshop/performance`**
**Move these workflows (2 total):**
- `dev-workshop-instant-preview.yml` → Move here (specific to workshop development)
- `dev-performance-optimization.yml` → Move here (performance-specific)

### **Branch: `staging`**
**Move these workflows (2 total):**
- `staging-comprehensive-validation.yml` → Move here (staging-specific)
- `staging-production-readiness-alert.yml` → Move here (staging completion)

### **Branch: `master`**
**Move these workflows (1 total):**
- `production-master-deploy.yml` → Move here (production-only)

### **Remove from all branches (1 total):**
- `dev-preview-validation.yml` → Remove (redundant with instant preview)

## 📊 **Benefits of This Distribution**

### **🎯 Reduced Clutter**
- Each branch only has workflows relevant to its purpose
- No unnecessary workflow files in branches that don't use them
- Cleaner repository structure per branch

### **⚡ Performance Benefits**
- Faster checkout times (fewer .github/workflows files per branch)
- No workflow parsing for irrelevant files
- Cleaner GitHub Actions interface per branch

### **🛡️ Security & Isolation**
- Workflows can't accidentally trigger from wrong branches
- Better security isolation per environment
- Reduced risk of workflow conflicts

### **👥 Developer Experience**
- Developers see only relevant workflows for their branch
- Clear understanding of what automation exists per branch
- Easier to maintain and debug branch-specific issues

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create branch-specific workflow commits**
2. **Move workflow files to appropriate branches**
3. **Remove unnecessary workflows from each branch**
4. **Test workflow triggers on each branch**
5. **Update documentation for new structure**

---

**🎯 This creates a clean, efficient, branch-specific workflow architecture!**
